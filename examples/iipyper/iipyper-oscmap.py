"""
This example demonstrates how to use the OSCMap class to map OSC messages to Python functions and vice versa.

When this example is run, a Pd patch is created in the background.
When the Pd patch is opened, it will send and receive messages to this iipyper server.
It is possible to output a Max patch instead by altering the command-line arguments.

    OSC

    First, we create an OSC instance and a client. 
    '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
    osc = OSC(host, receive_port, verbose=True, concurrent=True)
    client_name = "iipyper-example"
    osc.create_client(client_name, client, send_port)
    
    '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
    OSC Mapping

    Then, we create an OSCMap instance.
    This simple example OSCMap shows one send function and one receive function.
    We add functions to the OSCMap instance using the `add` method.
    In the `@osc_map.add()` decorator we specify OSC parameters as `name=(default, min, max)`.
    The additional variables `io`, `count`, and `send_mode` describe differnet behaviours:
    - `io` can be `send` or `receive`
    - `count` is the number of times the function is called before sending or receiving
    - `send_mode` can be `broadcast` or `event`, describing whether the message is sent continuously, or only when called manually.
    We also use type hints in the method signature for sends and receives, and also return type hints for receives, which should always be a tuple.
